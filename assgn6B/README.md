This project is best viewed in a 1024x900 resolution due to the original designs having been created for that generic Desktop size in the Sketch app.
However, as noted in the Homework 6 write-up, this project is also compatible with 1366x768 resolution. 

One change from 6A is that I decided to alter the way the cart icon counted orders. Instead of counting individual buns, I decided to count "add to carts" (no matter the number of buns) as one order. This was a change created after some user testing and feedback and indicated the more intuitive nature of counting in this manner.

The new dynamic feature on the Cart page is the ability to see what an order is, accurate to what the user entered on 'original.html', and delete it. To delight and engage the user, images for the type of bun and the glaze were utilized on the cart.

All iconography and code that was found from outside resources is noted in the .html, .js, and .css files. They will be noted by attribution comments.

In addition, all other image attributions (mainly on the PLP) are cited in the file 'imageAttributions.png'.

Thank you!
