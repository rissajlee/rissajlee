        <h3>If on a winter&apos;s night a traveler</h3><br><br>
        Italo Calvino imagines a novel capable of endless mutations in
        this intricately crafted story about writing and readers.
        If on a Winter&apos;s Night a Traveler turns out to be not one novel but ten
        with a different plot, style, ambience, and author, and each interrupted
        at a moment of suspense. Together they form a labyrinth of literatures,
        known and unknown, alive and extinct, through which two readers, a male and a
        female, pursue both the story lines that intrigue them and one another.

          <h3>Invisible Cities</h3><br><br>
          In a garden sit the aged Kublai Khan and the young
          Marco Polo &mdash; Mongol emperor and Venetian traveler. Kublai
          Khan has sensed the end of his empire coming soon. Marco Polo
          diverts his host with stories of the cities he has seen in his
          travels around the empire: cities and memory, cities and desire,
          cities and designs, cities and the dead, cities and the sky,
          trading cities, hidden cities. As Marco Polo unspools his tales,
          the emperor detects these fantastic places are more than they appear.

        <h3>The Baron in the Trees</h3><br><br>
        Cosimo di Rondo, a young Italian nobleman of the eighteenth century, 
        rebels against his parents by climbing into the trees and remaining there 
        for the rest of his life. He adapts efficiently to an existence in the forest
        canopy &mdash; he hunts, sows crops, plays games with earth-bound friends, 
        fights forest fires, solves engineering problems, and even manages to have
        love affairs. From his perch in the trees, Cosimo sees the Age of Enlightenment
        pass by and a new century dawn.

      <h3>Under the Jaguar Sun</h3><br><br>
      These intoxicating stories delve down to the core of our senses of taste, 
      hearing, and smell. Amid the flavors of Mexico&apos;s fiery chiles and spices, 
      a couple on holiday discovers dark secrets about the maturing desire in 
      the title story, &quot;Under the Jaguar Sun.&quot; In &quot;A King Listens,&quot;	
      a gripping portrait of a frenzied mind, the menacing echoes in a huge palace
      spur a tyrant&apos;s thoughts to the heights of paranoid intensity. &quot;The Name, 
      the Nose&quot;	drives to a startling conclusion as men across time and space
      pursue the women whose aromas have enchanted them. Mordant and deliciously 
      offbeat, this trio of tales is a treat from a master of short fiction.

      <h3>Italian Folktales</h3><br><br>
      Filed with kings and peasants, saints and ogres &mdash; as well as some 
      quite extraordinary plants and animals &mdash; these two hundred tales 
      bring to life Italy's folklore, sometimes with earthy humor, sometimes 
      with noble mystery, and sometimes with the playfulness of sheer nonsense.

      <h3>Difficult Loves</h3><br><br>
      In Difficult Loves, Italy&apos;s master storyteller weaves tales in which 
      cherished deceptions and illusions of love &mdash; including self-love 
      &mdash; are swept away in magical instants of recognition. A soldier is 
      reduced to quivering fear by the presence of a full-figured woman in his 
      train compartment; a young clerk leaves a lady&apos;s bed at dawn; a young 
      woman is isolated from bathers on a beach by the loss of her bikini bottom.
      Each of them discovers hidden truths beneath the surface of everyday life.
