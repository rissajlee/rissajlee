This project is best viewed in a 1024x900 resolution. 
This is due to the original designs having been created for that generic Desktop size in the Sketch app.

The three pages of interest for this homework assignment are 'index.html', 'shop.html', and 'original.html', which correlate to the homepage, shop page, and original bun bun page respectively.

All iconography and code that was found from outside resources is noted in the .html and .css files. They will be noted by attribution comments.

In addition, all other image attributions (mainly on the PLP) are cited in the file 'imageAttributions.png'.

Thank you!
