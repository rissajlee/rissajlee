This project is best viewed in a 1024x900 resolution due to the original designs having been created for that generic Desktop size in the Sketch app.
However, as noted in the Homework 6 write-up, this project is also compatible with 1366x768 resolution. 

The new page is the Cart, which is listed as 'cart.html'.

The new dynamic features on the PDP, which is listed as 'original.html' are 1) updating total cost according to selected radio button, 2) updated image according to selected glaze button, and 3) highlighted glaze button upon selection.

All iconography and code that was found from outside resources is noted in the .html, .js, and .css files. They will be noted by attribution comments.

In addition, all other image attributions (mainly on the PLP) are cited in the file 'imageAttributions.png'.

Thank you!
